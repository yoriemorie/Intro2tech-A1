<strong style="font-size:150%">Myers-Briggs test results:</strong> 
  <p style="font-size:150%">INTJ-The Mastermind(very good match)</p>
  <p style="font-size:150%">INTP-The Architect(very good match)</p>
  <p style="font-size:150%">ENTJ-The Inventor(good match)</p>

<strong style="font-size:150%">Learning Style test results:</strong> 
  <p style="font-size:150%">Auditory-40%</p>
  <p style="font-size:150%">Visual-35%</p>
  <p style="font-size:150%">Tactile-25%</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:150%">Big Five test results:</strong> 
  <p style="font-size:150%">Openess-77%</p>
  <p style="font-size:150%">Conscientiousness-40%</p>
  <p style="font-size:150%">Extraversion-44%</p>
  <p style="font-size:150%">Agreeableness-37.5%</p>
  <p style="font-size:150%">Neuroticism-65%</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:150%">What do these results mean for me?</strong> 
  <p style="font-size:150%">These results mean so many things to me.Take my high score for Openess for example,this shows that i have a greater willingness to explore abstract ideas which i feel is very true because i often enjoy learning about abstract ideas like politics.However, my lowest score was on Agreeableness which is essentially the trait about how well you work with others. This might be a problem for when the group projects start, maybe. Also, my learning style resutls are spot on as i have always learned mostly by listening.Additionally, my Meyers-Briggs results look similar the results on my big five test which is no suprise.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:150%">How do i think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</strong> 
  <p style="font-size:150%">I think these results will make me more aware of my habits that i have when i interact with others.It will make me aware that i learn best when i just listen so thats what i will do most during group talks.It also says that i have poor cooperation habits with others, i will make conscious effort to be aware of this short coming if i feel a conflict is started or has started.Also,i had a relatively high rating for Neuroticism which means i will have to try my best not to allow my emotions to distract me. </p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:150%">How should i take this into account when forming a team?</strong> 
  <p style="font-size:150%">When forming a team you always choose a combination of people that are skilled and are easy to work with.But you don't really know how well you can work with someone until you are acutally into a deep part of the project.This creates an element of uncertainity and risk.However, this can solved or reduced by comparing test scores with other people and creating a team of people that have a personailty similar to you or complement you personality  </p>
